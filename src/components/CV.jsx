          <br />
          Jacob's paintings often directly represent the political and moral
          issues arising from the unique reality in Israel / Palestine. <br />
          He receives a lot of inspiration from his past service in the Israeli
          Defense Forces and from current events, specifically the everyday life
          of underprivileged parts of the israeli society. <br />
          Jacobâ€™s works consist of paintings, drawings, prints, installations
          and mixed media. <br />
