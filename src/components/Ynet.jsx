        <h2>Oded Jacob: Oceans and Continents </h2>
      </a>

      <p>
        A new solo exhibition opened in the Left Bank gallery in Tel Aviv
        presenting the works of artist Oded Jacob. <br /> Jacob was born in 1987
        in Even Yehuda, lives and works in Tel Aviv, graduate of the Department
        of Multidisciplinary Art, Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and
        Art, Ramat Gan, 2013.
        <br /> In the exhibition he presents a body of work made in the past two
        years, in which he showcases a representation of conflict between the
        person and the collective, and conflicts within the media of painting
        itself: abstract versus figurative, emptiness versus abundance, illusion
        of depth versus the texture of a painting's surface.
        <br /> The influences of the local cultural and political discourse are
        evident in his works alongside images relating to personal memory and
        experience.
        <br /> The exhibition takes place until February 15th, in 70 Ahad Ha'am
        st. Tel Aviv, <br />
        Opening hours: Sunday 15:00-18:00, Fridays and Saturdays 11:00-14:00.
