        “Juklook’s Service”, the site specific installation made by Oded Jacob
        in the Jerusalem Artist’s House, is an imaginary, chaotic space that
        encapsulates military elements that are disarmed of their original use
        in means of deformation and theatrical exaggeration. <br /> <br />
        These surreal, grotesque, hybrid images which inflict collective terror
        and anxiety are used as a surface for realistic and expressive drawings.
        <br /> <br />
        They reveal the world of a young artist, dealing with questions of his
        own identity within the global and israeli artistic system. Jacob unites
        both the military and figurative languages in a parodic and threatening
        manner simultaneously. <br /> <br />
        The art as a representative of freedom, freedom of speech and
        imagination, is assimilated in the local code apparent in the military,
        khaki-olive green fabric,as a surface replacing the classic white
        canvas. The personal and the political are piled in the space as if in a
        shadow play.
