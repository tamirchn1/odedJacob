          Jacob's paintings often directly represent the political and moral
          issues arising from the unique reality in Israel / Palestine. He
          receives a lot of inspiration from his past service in the Israeli
          Defense Forces and from current events, specifically the everyday life
          of underprivileged parts of the israeli society. Jacobâ€™s works consist
          of paintings, drawings, prints, installations and mixed media. <br />
          <br />
          Jacob studied art in Shenkar Multidisciplinary Art School (B.F.A) in
          Ramat Gan, Israel.
